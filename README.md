# Loan_default_prediction
Goal of this project:

Perform exploratory data analysis. This should include creating statistical summaries and charts, testing for anomalies, checking for correlations and other relations between variables, and other EDA elements.

Create a model to provide risk evaluation as a service for retail banks.

For this purpose I use dataset that can be downloaded: https://storage.googleapis.com/341-home-credit-default/home-credit-default-risk.zip

Deploy these machine learning models to Google Cloud Platform : https://my-app-capstone-403817.nw.r.appspot.com/

For smooth exploration please follow the path of files for EDA part:
